# Fiery

Fiery is an old idea of mine to create a programming language that is
pure object-oriented, and pure functional at the same time.

Pure object-oriented means that every value in the language is an
object, and that there is the concept of a current object ("this"),
dynamic dispatching and "change of perspective" using the dot
operator.

Pure functional means that the language does not have mutability and
variables. All code are functions, and all that functions do is
compute a value.

Currently, this is much more a scratchboard for ideas and a sandbox
for playing around with syntax and semantics. No very much to see ...
